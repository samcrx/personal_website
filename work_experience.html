                    <p> I contributed to the development of the <a
                            href="https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete">Concrete</a> project , which is an open-source
                        Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) compiler framework. This project enables developers to
                        effortlessly create applications capable of performing computations on encrypted data without
                        the need for decryption and prior knowledge. My contributions helped in simplifying complex
                        cryptographic challenges, such as noise management and crypto parameter selection, thereby
                        making FHE more accessible to developers and data scientists.

                        I also contributed to the cryptographic library called <a
                            href="https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs">TFHE-rs</a>.</p>
                    <!-- Additionally, I was involved in extending the core framework to develop Concrete Numpy, a privacy-preserving machine learning inference framework. This extension facilitates the transformation of high-level Python programs into FHE equivalents, significantly enhancing privacy and security in data processing applications." -->

                    <p> I delved into researching innovative neural network layers tailored specifically for the TFHE
                        homomorphic encryption scheme. Our objective was to enhance secure computations, particularly
                        when working with sensitive information. To test our solutions in practice, we participated in
                        the iDash 2019 competition. This challenging event emphasized the use of neural network
                        inference to process encrypted biological data, demonstrating the potential of our research in
                        real-world applications. Throughout this project, I mostly used Python and C++.</p>

                    <p> I was tasked with enhancing the security of BPCE's mobile applications. I began by assessing the
                        security measures of both existing and in-development apps. After identifying the key security
                        features, I conducted a thorough risk analysis and determined the interconnections among these
                        features. Subsequently, I developed proof-of-concept security solutions that met our standards,
                        with a specific focus on TEE and Whitebox methodologies. This work was conducted using Python,
                        Java, Objective-C, Kotlin, and Swift.</p>

                    <p> During a research project and an internship, I explored the statistical relationships between
                        adjacent pixels to develop an integration strategy for <em>steganography</em> and created
                        training sets
                        minimizing the <em>Cover Source Mismatch</em> during tests on disjointed sets of images. <br>
                        <br>
                        My primary objective was to use classifiers trained on large image datasets to identify photos
                        altered using steganography. In this process, I examined how different parameters affected image
                        creation. This work was conducted using Python and MATLAB.
